# 🎵 Spotify Clone (Frontend)

A fully functional frontend clone of Spotify built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project mimics the core functionalities of Spotify like playing songs, showing albums, updating seekbar, volume control, and playlist handling – all without any backend integration.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Songs are fetched from local directories using `fetch()` on a local server (like `http-server` or VSCode Live Server).
- Album metadata (like title, description, and cover) is read from each folder's `info.json` file.
- Users can:
  - View available albums
  - Click on an album to load the playlist
  - Play any song
  - Control playback and volume
  - View current time/duration
